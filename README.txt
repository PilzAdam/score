Score game for the Minetest engine
===================================

Installation:
-------------
Place it in $path_user/games/ and select it in the main menu.

Tips and Tricks:
----------------
- The main goal is to mine Score
- Place a light after spawning so you can see stuff
    - If you are unable to do that, try placing the light under yourself while
      jumping and looking down
- Levels are annular around spawn
- To speed up your pick you need iron from the current level
- To level up you need iron from the next level
- To get more light you need coal
- Turrets are the only source of damage; there is no fall damage
- To heal you need turrets
- When you die you spawn nearby, so you get a chance to get your light back
- It is not considered cheating to use the coordinates in the F5 info
    - If you want a real challenge do it without this
- Sometimes you spawn inside of blocks
    - Create a new world or dig yourself out in this case
